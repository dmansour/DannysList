Solution found here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/set-password.html

To change your mysql password do the following.
log into mysql (mysql -u root -p)
type in current password

type select current_user();
this displays the name of current user (such as root@locahost)

type set password for 'root'@'localhost' = password('new password');
now your password has been changed.
